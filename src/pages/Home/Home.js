                <p>Recompense is a community driven application for paying reparations. Users can post services to offer, make service requests, and donate to individuals in need. In the ongoing effort to redistribute resources and care, we hope this application will help further the task of connecting individuals to resources that they need, and the resources that individuals can provide to others.</p>
